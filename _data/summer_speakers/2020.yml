    The Bloomberg Terminal has provided ways for investors and journalists to sift through and understand the immense volume of tweets and discover financially-relevant content ever since the SEC approved the use of Twitter for company disclosures back in 2013. In the first part of the talk, I will showcase how tweets impact financial markets and how Bloomberg is using Natural Language Processing methods to identify financially relevant tweets that move the markets. Our processing pipeline feeds directly to clients, journalists in the newsroom and powers several news analytic products offered by the company including trending companies and consumer sentiment for publicly traded equities.<br><br>
    However, understanding user pragmatic intent in individual tweets would allow us to gain deeper insights and enable new applications. I will present several recent research studies focused on understanding intent including identifying complaints and the roles with which vulgarity is used in social media and how these can help improve applications such as sentiment analysis and hate speech detection.

  title: Visual Dialog - Towards Communicative Visual Agents
  bio: >
    Satwik Kottur is a research scientist at Facebook AI Applied Research (FAIAR), Menlo Park. He recently obtained his PhD degree (2019) from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. José M. F. Moura; and his undergraduate degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, India (2014).<br><br>
    His research interests are in solving high-level multimodal AI problems, specifically at the intersection of language and vision. His recent works explore communicative visual agents, which interact with humans in natural language about visual content. In the past, he has worked on problems related to video surveillance, scalable machine learning, and learning grounded word representations.<br><br>
    He has been the recipient of the Snap Inc. Fellowship (2018), best paper award (EMNLP 2017, short paper), best reviewer award (NeurIPS 2017), and Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT) Dean’s Fellowship (2014).
  abstract: >
    Humans interact with artificial intelligence (AI) systems on a day-to-day basis, for example, through natural language (search queries), speech (voice assistant), vision (face recognition), etc. However, the next generation of AI systems will need to go beyond these interactions and be able to hold a meaningful dialog with humans in natural language about visual content.<br><br>
    In this talk, I will motivate and study such ‘Communicative Visual Agents’ through the novel task of visual dialog, which requires an agent to answer a series of questions grounded in an image, using the dialog history as context. Specifically, the talk will: (a) formalize visual dialog, laying emphasis on the role of dataset and objective evaluation to benchmark progress, (b) describe explicit reasoning models for visual dialog, and, (c) extend visual dialog to goal-driven, visual agents that have ubiquitous applications.

  abstract: >
    Recently we have seen an exciting confluence of fields to solve problems at the intersection of computer vision, reinforcement learning, and language understanding. Specifically, after achieving high accuracy on passive and curated datasets, computer vision researchers have moved to solve vision in interactive agents or embodied settings. However, current embodied agent research and tasks are narrowly focused on building AI for a single agent which is contrary to human interaction. Consequently, this talk will focus on building a collaborative framework for multiple embodied agents to solve demanding real-world tasks.<br><br>
    If you are interested in learning about the interplay of RL and vision, multi-agent RL algorithms, or seeing what agents “talk” while collaborating to solve tasks -- join in for the talk.

    Entity Linking for Low-Resource Languages
  bio: >
    Shruti Rijhwani is a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. Her primary research interest is multilingual natural language processing, with a focus on low-resource and endangered languages. Her research is supported by a Bloomberg Data Science Ph.D. Fellowship. Much of her published work focuses on improving named entity recognition and entity linking for low-resource languages and domains.
  abstract: >
    Entity linking is the task of associating a named entity with its corresponding entry in a structured knowledge base (such as Wikipedia or Freebase). Entity linking is an important component for the automatic understanding of natural language documents. While entity linking systems for languages such as English and Spanish are well-developed, the performance in low-resource languages is significantly worse.<br><br>
    In this talk, we discuss existing methods for entity linking and the associated challenges of adapting them to low-resource languages. We then present a suite of methods developed for entity linking that does not rely heavily on resources in the target language. Through a variety of experiments, we show the success of our proposed methods on multiple languages, including extremely low-resource languages such as Tigrinya, Oromo, Lao and Uyghur.

  abstract: >
    Graph representation learning has received significant interest in the machine learning community. Different types of algorithms such as skip-gram based optimization, matrix factorization, deep-autoencoders and more recently, graph neural networks are proposed in the literature. Analysis of outliers in a graph is important as all real-life networks contain outlier nodes. A (community) outlier in a graph is a node which violets the overall community structure of the graph. Recent studies have shown that outlier nodes can affect the embeddings of other regular nodes in a graph. Further, their embeddings can get mixed easily with other regular nodes, which makes it difficult to detect them by post-processing. So, it is important to reduce the effect of outlier nodes on the embeddings of other nodes in a graph and detect them in an integrated way.<br><br>
    In this talk, we will characterize different types of outliers present in an attributed graph. We discuss some recent approaches which integrate outlier detection and network embedding into a single framework, and hence minimize the effect of outliers on the embeddings of regular nodes in a graph. We would also present a set of experimental results to motivate the problem and to show the usefulness of such integrated approaches.

    Emergency response to spatial-temporal incidents like crimes and accidents is a major challenge in today’s world. This talk will focus on two problems in this context. In the first segment, we will look at how robust machine learning models can help combat crimes like illegal poaching. While there are a variety of incident prediction models available to identify spatial-temporal patterns in such incidents, they fail to take attacker evasion into account. Specifically, poachers can shift their spatial preferences for committing crimes by observing patrols. This talk will present a general framework that models the interaction between off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms and attackers as a Stackelberg game. We will look at how such a game model works and how it can be solved to design patrol strategies. In the second segment, the talk will focus on how creating decentralized multi-agent approaches can improve emergency response in urban areas.

    Major B2C eCommerce websites (such as Amazon, Spotify, Swiggy) can be thought of as two-sided platforms, with customers on one side and producers on the other. Traditionally, recommendation protocols of these platforms are customer-centric---focusing on maximizing  customer satisfaction by tailoring the recommendation according to the personalized preferences of individual customers. However, this may lead to unfair distribution of exposure among the producers and adversely impact their well-being. As more and more people depend on such platforms to earn a living, it is important to strike a balance between fairness among the producers and customer satisfaction. The problem of two-sided fairness in recommendation can be formulated as a matroid constrained fair allocation problem. This problem naturally captures a number of other resource-allocation applications, including budgeted course allocation, graph partition, and allocation of cloud computing resources. Our main contribution is to develop polynomial time algorithms for fair allocation of indivisible items (with formal guarantees on fairness and feasibility) in several practical scenarios which can be formulated as matroid constrained problems.<br><br>
    In this talk, I’ll start by motivating the problem and then defining some popular fairness notions. Next, I’ll discuss the matroid constrained fair allocation problem, and show how the solutions can be applied to ensure two-sided fair recommendation. I’ll conclude by listing down some open problems.

  bio: >
    Eunice Jun is a PhD student in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. Her research focuses on developing new tools and methods for conducting valid and reproducible statistical analyses. She hopes to make conducting valid data analyses easy (and fun) for end-users. She incorporates methods and techniques from human-computer interaction, programming languages, software engineering, and data science. Her work has been supported by a UW CSE Wilma Bradley Fellowship and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
  abstract: >
    Current statistical tools place the burden of valid, reproducible statistical analyses on the user. Users must have deep knowledge of statistics to not only identify their research questions, hypotheses, and domain assumptions but also select valid statistical tests for their hypotheses. As quantitative data become increasingly available in all disciplines, data analysis will continue to become a common task for people who may not have statistical expertise. Tea, a high-level declarative language for automating statistical test selection and execution, abstracts the details of analyses from users, empowering them to perform valid analyses by expressing their goals and domain knowledge. In this talk, I will discuss the design and implementation of Tea, lessons learned through the process, and other related ongoing work at the University of Washington. *<b>The talk is designed to be friendly for a non-technical audience with many opportunities for technical, conceptual, and other research-related questions.</b>*

  title: Understanding training of depth 2 nets under minimal distributional assumptions and data poisoning attacks
  bio: >
    Anirbit, is a (final) year Ph.D. student in applied mathematics at the Johns Hopkins University advised by Prof. Amitabh Basu. He specializes in deep-learning theory and has been awarded 2 fellowships from JHU for this research, "Walter L.Robb Fellowship" and the inaugural "Mathematical Institute for Data Science Fellowship." Earlier, he was a researcher in Quantum Field Theory, while doing his undergrad in physics at the Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI) and masters in theoretical physics at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR). For more details, you can visit his <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/anirbit/home" target="_blank">website</a>.
  abstract: >
    The question of provable training of neural nets is mathematically extremely challenging and vastly open. Over the last year, we have investigated certain special cases at depth 2 and have given provable guarantees in regimes hitherto unexplored. Our results probe the particularly challenging trifecta of having finitely large nets, while not tying the data to any specific distribution and while having an adversarial attack.
    <br><br>
    We will try to cover 3 of our results in this talk : (a) analysis of a simple stochastic algorithm which near-optimally provably trains a single ReLU gate in the realizable setting as well as under a data poisoning attack using only mild distributional assumptions, (b) showing that noise assisted gradient descent on a ReLU gate can be proven to be "diffusive" in nature without having to make any distributional assumptions beyond realizability and lastly (c) we demonstrate a class of iterative non-gradient algorithms ("Neuro-Tron") which can train a class of "singe filter" depth 2 nets under a data poisoning attack on true realizable labels s.t the error in the recovered weights scales inversely with the width above a certain finite threshold. This provably brings to light the advantage of having a large width when defending against an adversarial attack.

  title: Neural Module Networks for Reasoning over Text
  bio: >
    Nitish is a senior PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania pursuing research in NLP. He is advised by Prof. Dan Roth and co-advised by Prof. Sameer Singh, UCI. Nitish's research focuses on developing structured models for grounded language understanding, primarily in the context of making machines understand and answer questions against text. He is particularly interested in models that perform reasoning by understanding the compositional nature of language, and are able to provide a formal semantic parse and an explanation about their predictions. For more details you can visit <a href="https://nitishgupta.github.io/" target="_blank">https://nitishgupta.github.io/</a>.
  abstract: >
    Answering compositional questions that require multiple steps of reasoning against text is challenging, especially when they involve discrete, symbolic operations. In this talk, I will outline the challenges in learning these models for non-synthetic questions on open-domain text, where a model needs to deal with the diversity of natural language and perform a broad range of reasoning. I will present our interpretable and modular neuro-symbolic approach based on neural module networks (NMNs) and show how we extend NMNs by: (a) introducing modules that reason over a paragraph of text, performing symbolic reasoning over numbers and dates in a probabilistic and differentiable manner; and (b) proposing unsupervised auxiliary loss to help learning. In conclusion, I will present our recent work on methods for achieving faithfull interpretations in such compositional models and challenges for future research.
