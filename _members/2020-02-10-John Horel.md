His research is centered on the observation and analysis of weather and climate processes in mountainous regions. His current research activities include further development of MesoWest and SynopticLabs (see http://mesowest.utah.edu, https://synopticlabs.org), which provide access to surface weather observations for operational, research, and educational applications. They also provide a foundation from which to conduct research to improve numerical models and data assimilation techniques over complex terrain and evaluate the cost effectiveness of surface observing networks. He also am involved in research and development related to fire weather applications, the Great Salt Lake, and air quality along the Wasatch Front and in the Uintah Basin.
