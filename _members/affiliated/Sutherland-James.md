His research interests are at the confluence of numerical analysis, engineering, and computer science, with emphasis on large-scale simulation of turbulent reacting flows and in developing algorithms and software to deploy these simulations on massively parallel computers. This includes development of domain-specific languages for solution of large systems of partial differential equations and constructing reduced-order modeling for complex reacting flows where lower-dimensional manifolds exist.
