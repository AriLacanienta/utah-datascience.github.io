He studies the fundamental properties of the Universe through observational cosmology. He is the Principal Investigator for the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) at Apache Point Observatory. In eBOSS, they will place the most precise distance constraints to date in the 0.8<z<3.5 redshift range. He also help prepare the cosmology program for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). DESI will begin in 2020 and will be 10X larger than any other spectroscopic program.
