With Prof. Adam S. Bolton, they are currently using the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS3) to discover new strong gravitational galaxy lenses. In conjunction with follow-up Hubble Space Telescope (HST) multi-color images of the galaxy lenses detected in the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) survey, they are providing constraints on structure formation and galaxy evolution problems.
