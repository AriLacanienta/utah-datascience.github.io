I'm interested in the problem of *algorithmic fairness*: ensuring that in a world of automated decision-making, decisions that get made about us and for us are fair, accountable and transparent.

This is the culmination of a series of research explorations that started with algorithms and computational geometry, lifted to high dimensional geometry and sublinear algorithms, with a random sampling of work in clustering and kernel methods.
